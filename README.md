# AxBind
> Make one key-map to rule them all.
## Overview

AxBind is the product of an indecisive and naive linux user who just wanted all of their programs to have the same key-bindings, but couldn't help but change them **every damn day**.

At it's core, AxBind is just a search-and-replace text program; however, it provides a declarative configuration system that creates concrete definitions for string mappings and functions. These mappings and functions can then be linked to desired files, allowing many files to follow the same text replacement schema. Fine-tuned modifications can be made per-file for any desired/required foramatting differences.

AxBind is written in Rust and all configuration files of AxBind use [toml](https://toml.io/en/) syntax.

# Command Usage

#### ```axbind <root directory> [<options>]```

`<root directory>`: \
Directory to recursively search for tagged directories and apply AxBind mappings (ex: `~/.config`).

### Options

`--config=<path>`: \
Sets the [Master Config File](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#master-config-file) path. \
If unset, checks the following paths in-order:
1. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/axbind/config.toml`
2. `$HOME/.config/axbind/config.toml`
3. `/etc/axbind/config.toml`


# Documentation
**For quickly getting started, consider looking at the [example configuration](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2/tree/main/example_config).**

## Preface
All configuration files are [toml](https://toml.io/en/) tables, and are documented as shown:

| Key | Type | Description |
|:----|:-----|:------------|
| `example_key` | **?** Example | Description of what the value for this key represents. |

All keys are required unless it's 'Type' is marked with a **?** as shown above.

The documentation defines toml sub-objects/components in the same format.


## Master Config File

Defines how AxBind searches and reads the filesystem and interprets it's own sub-config files.

| Key | Type | Description |
|:----|:-----|:------------|
| `map_directory` | String | Path that AxBind reads for [Map Files](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#map-file), relative to this Master Config File's directory.  |
| `function_directory` | String | Path that AxBind reads for [Function Files](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#function-file), relative to this Master Config File's directory. |
| `tag_directory` | String | Path of directory that AxBind recursively searches for inside the specified [root directory](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#root-directory). Matching paths are deemed 'tag directories', and the directory *containing* them are "tagged" for AxBind modification. |
| `tag_entry_point` | String | Path to the [Tag Entry Point File](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#tag-entry-point-file) in each 'tag directory'. |
| `options.meta` | [Meta Options](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#meta-options) | Default [Meta Options](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#meta-options). *Currently the only place where [Meta Options](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#meta-options) are specified.* |
| `options.group` | [Group Options](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#group-options) | Default [Group Options](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#group-options) if they are unspecified in a [Tag Group File](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#tag-group-file). |
| `options.layer` | [Layer Options](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#layer-options) | Default [Layer Options](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#layer-options) if they are unspecified in a [Layer](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#layer). |

### Example
```toml
# .../config.toml
map_directory = 'maps'
function_directory = 'functions'
tag_directory = '.axbind'
tag_entry_point = 'main.toml'

[options.meta]
escape_sequence = '|'
wildcard_char = '^'

[options.group]
axbind_file_format = '^.axbind'

[options.layer]
escape_sequence = '|'
key_format = '@^@'
```

## Map File

Defines a [Map](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#map). \
Contained within the map directory.

| \<any> | String | Key-value pairs that make up this Map. |
| `@INCLUDE` | **?** String[] | List of Map names; This Map will inherit all key-value pairs of the Maps specified, in-order (Maps specified last will override duplicate keys). Key-value pairs directly specified in this Map *(are supposed too [See [Issues](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2/issues)])* override included Maps. |

#### Example
```toml
#<...>
foo = 'myFooReplacement'
bar = 'myBarReplacement'
#<...>
```

## Function File

Defines a [Function](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#function).

command = 'echo -n "This used to be ^"'
#<...>
```

## Tag Entry Point File

Defines the order in which [Tag Group Files](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#tag-group-file) will be applied to the parent directory. \
A Tag Entry Point File must be present in every tag directory.

If only one group is desired, you may treat a Tag Entry Point File as a [Tag Group File](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#tag-group-file).

|:----|:-----|:------------|
| `groups`* | **?** String[] | List of paths to [Tag Group Files](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#tag-group-file) relative to the 'tag directory'. [Tag Group Files](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#tag-group-file) are evaluated in the order specified. |

### Example

```toml
# ~/.config/lf/.axbind/main.toml
groups = [
  'colors.toml',
  'keybindings.toml'
]
```

## Tag Group File

Defines [Layers](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#layer) and the files they should be applied too.

If multiple Tag Group Files specify the same file, the **last** one, according to the order in the [Tag Entry Point File](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#tag-entry-point-file), will take **full** precedence.

| Key | Type | Description |
|:----|:-----|:------------|
| `files` | String[] | List of file paths relative to the \*tagged\* directory that this group affects. Specified file paths will be *written* to after reading each files respective 'AxBind file' (See [Group Options](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#group-options)). |
| `options` | **?** [Group Options](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#group-options) | This group's options. Overrides the defaults specified in the [Master Config File](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#master-config-file). |
| `layers` | [Layer](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#layer)[] | [Layers](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#layer) to apply—in order—to all axbind files that this group affects. [Layers](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#layer) are applied one-after-another and will read the output of the previous. |

### Example
```toml
# ~/.config/lf/.axbind/keybindings.toml
files = [
  'lfrc'
]
options.axbind_file_format = '^.myCustomExtension'
[[layers]]
map = 'myKeybindings'
remaps = [ 'myLfRemaps' ]
options.key_format = '%^%'
```

## Layer

A specification on how AxBind should work on a file.

Component of [Tag Group File](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#tag-group-file).

| Key | Type | Description |
|:----|:-----|:------------|
| `map` | String | [Map](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#map) name; all instances of this [Map](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#map)'s keys in the specified [key format](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#layer-options) will be replaced with its respective value (after specified `remaps` and `functions` are applied to it) when this [Layer](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#layer) is applied. |
| `remaps` | String[] | List of [Map](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#map) names; each value of `map` will be re-mapped (values used as keys) by these [Maps](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#map), one-after-another in-order. |
| `functions` | String[] | List of [Function](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#function) names; each value of `map` will be modified by these [Functions](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#function), one-after-another in-order. *`functions` are applied *after* all remaps (see [Issues](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2/issues)).* |
| `options` | **?** [Layer Options](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#layer-options)[] | This Layer's options. Overrides the defaults specified in the [Master Config File](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#master-config-file).  |

### Example
```toml
#<...>
map = 'myKeybindings'
remaps = [ 'myLfRemaps' ]
options.key_format = '%^%'
#<...>
```

## Meta Options

Options relating to how AxBind interprets its own config files.

Component of [Master Config File](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#master-config-file).

| Key | Type | Description |
|:----|:-----|:------------|
| `escape_sequence` | **?** String | [Escape sequence](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#escape-sequence) that is recognized by AxBind when interpreting [Key Strings](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#key-string). *Currently is only useful for escaping the `wildcard_char`.* |
| `wildcard_char` | **?** String | Must be a single character; character representing the arbitrary input/value in a [Key String](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#key-string), replaced with an actual value at evaluation depending on the context. *(See [Key String](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#key-string))* |

### Example
```toml
#<...>
escape_sequence = '|'
wildcard_char = '^'
#<...>
```

### Text Evaluation Definitions
**Key String:** \
A string that, when evaluated, has all instances of the 'wildcard' (`wildcard_char`) replaced with another value. \
*Wildcards can be [escaped](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#escape-sequence).*

**Escape Sequence:** \
A character sequence that, when encountered during text-evaluation, is replaced with nothing and 'escapes' the very next character.

An escaped character is **absolutely** ignored by all text-evaluation rules, as if it is not there, but will be present in the final text. \
*This is regardless of if the escaped character is "special" or not.* 



### Text Evaluation Example
> Given this [Map File](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#map-file):
```toml
axbind_map = 'foobar'
[map]
foo = 'BAR'
```
> Applying this [Layer](https://github.com/rtaylor034/axbind_2#layer):
```toml
map = 'foobar'
key_format = '@^@'
escape_sequence = '|'
```
> To this text:
```
1 @foo@
2 |@foo@
3 @foo@|
4 @f|oo@
5 ||@foo@
6 @fo|Ao@
se|c|ret| me|ssa|ge
```
> Yields the following:
```
1 BAR
2 @foo@
3 BAR
4 @foo@
5 |BAR
6 @foAo@
secret message
```
